Chat GPT Answer about the results:

Key Trends from the Data:
Niche skills command higher salaries
Tools like svn, solidity, couchbase, and datarobot are among the top-paying, with average salaries exceeding $150,000/year. These are not mainstream tools for typical data analysts, suggesting that specialized or cross-functional knowledge is highly valued.

Modern programming & engineering tools are in demand
Skills like golang, scala, terraform, and spark indicate that analysts who can bridge the gap between data analysis and data engineering or DevOps tend to earn more.

Big data stack is well-represented
Technologies like spark, airflow, kafka, and hadoop highlight a trend toward handling large-scale data workflows â€” a sign that data infrastructure skills can boost compensation for analysts.

Machine learning tools boost earning potential
Tools such as datarobot and h2o appear in the top ranks, suggesting that knowledge of ML platforms is a strong asset even for those with a data analyst title.

Basic tools like Excel or SQL are absent
Traditional tools don't show up in the top-paying list, reinforcing that advanced or less common tools lead to higher compensation.
